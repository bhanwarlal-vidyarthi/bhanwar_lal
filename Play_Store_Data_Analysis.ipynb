    "\n",
    "- Free apps heavily dominate the Google Play Store, indicating a strong preference for the free app model.\n",
    "- Paid apps exhibit slightly higher average ratings compared to free apps.\n",
    "- Most apps have relatively high ratings, suggesting generally positive user feedback.\n",
    "- Messenger-type apps have higher reviews as compared to other apps\n",
    "- Perfect ratings (5.0) should be interpreted cautiously, as they may result from a small number of reviews.\n",
    "- Reviews and installs are highly skewed, with a few apps capturing the majority of user engagement."
