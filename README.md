# Hi — I'm Bhanwar Lal 

I worked as a researcher in a chemical biology lab for 3 years,  focusing on polymeric hydrogels, coacervate-based tissue adhesives, and drug-delivery materials.  
I convert experimental data into clean, reproducible analysis and clear documentation.

##  Research Experience
- Polymeric hydrogels (drug delivery, swelling, release)
- Coacervate-based tissue adhesives for biomedical applications
- Drug release quantification (UV-vis based kinetics)
- Cell compatibility assays (MTT assay, scratch assay, cell proliferation)
- Long-term adhesion & mechanical testing


## Technical & Analytical Skills
- Python (pandas, numpy, metplotlib, seaborn)
- Git & GitHub
- Scientific data interpretation & reporting
- Data cleaning, structuring & reporting (EDA)
- MS Office, GraphPad Prism, Origin software
